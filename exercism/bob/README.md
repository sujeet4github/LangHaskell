# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.


## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

```
translateToWhatBobHears "Tom-ay-to, tom-aaaah-to."
translateToWhatBobHears "WATCH OUT!"
translateToWhatBobHears "FCECDFCAAB"
translateToWhatBobHears "Does this cryogenic chamber make me look fat?"
translateToWhatBobHears "You are, what, like 15?"
translateToWhatBobHears "fffbbcbeab?"
translatetowhatbobhears "let's go make out behind the gym!"
translateToWhatBobHears "It's OK if you don't want to go to the DMV."
translateToWhatBobHears "WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?"
translateToWhatBobHears "1, 2, 3 GO!"
translateToWhatBobHears "1, 2, 3"

translateToWhatBobHears ""
translateToWhatBobHears "          "
translateToWhatBobHears "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"
translateToWhatBobHears "\nDoes this cryogenic chamber make me look fat?\nno"
translateToWhatBobHears "         hmmmmmmm..."
translateToWhatBobHears "Okay if like my  spacebar  quite a bit?   "
translateToWhatBobHears "\n\r \t"
translateToWhatBobHears "This is a statement ending with whitespace      "
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
